I think it reads well and will be a useful contribution. 

My only concern is that it’s long and very detailed for a journal article. This
level of detail is great for internal use, but I’m not sure that many readers
of the journal would have the patience to follow at this level of detail. Also,
we’ll probably exceed the page limit for the journal. 

I notice an extraneous line at line 721. 

A couple of suggestions for reducing the length: 

I think Tables 1-4 can be eliminated.  I think this model system is useful, but
perhaps you could just describe the results in the text? In addition to
eliminating a full page of tables with numbers, that would allow you to
compress the text on page 16. 

I’m not sure that Appendix B is needed. 

I wonder if the discussion around the diagnostic variables is needed? It would
save a little space from multiple locations.

I’m not sure that Table 6 is needed, and the entire discussion around it can be
compressed. The year at which the code fails doesn’t really matter. What’s more
important is the conditions when SU gives a small update. Also, I would argue
that best practices here is to cut the time step anyway, so I’m not sure that
this is all that relevant. 

Also, I’m not a fan of putting equations in the Introduction. A large fraction
of your readers will move on the next article at that point. I’d try to
eliminate Eq 1 if possible.
