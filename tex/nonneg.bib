   title = {Evaluating litter decomposition in earth system models with long-term litterbag experiments: an example using the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4)},
   journal = {Global Change Biology},
   pages = {957-974},
   abstract = {Decomposition is a large term in the global carbon budget, but models of the earth system that simulate carbon cycle-climate feedbacks are largely untested with respect to litter decomposition. We tested the litter decomposition parameterization of the community land model version 4 (CLM4), the terrestrial component of the community earth system model, with data from the long-term intersite decomposition experiment team (LIDET). The LIDET dataset is a 10-year study of litter decomposition at multiple sites across North America and Central America. We performed 10-year litter decomposition simulations comparable with LIDET for 9 litter types and 20 sites in tundra, grassland, and boreal, conifer, deciduous, and tropical forest biomes using the LIDET-provided climatic decomposition index to constrain temperature and moisture effects on decomposition. We performed additional simulations with DAYCENT, a version of the CENTURY model, to ask how well an established ecosystem model matches the observations. The results show large discrepancy between the laboratory microcosm studies used to parameterize the CLM4 litter decomposition and the LIDET field study. Simulated carbon loss is more rapid than the observations across all sites, and nitrogen immobilization is biased high. Closer agreement with the observations requires much lower decomposition rates, obtained with the assumption that soil mineral nitrogen severely limits decomposition. DAYCENT better replicates the observations, for both carbon mass remaining and nitrogen, independent of nitrogen limitation. CLM4 has low soil carbon in global earth system simulations. These results suggest that this bias arises, in part, from too rapid litter decomposition. More broadly, the terrestrial biogeochemistry of earth system models must be critically tested with observations, and the consequences of particular model choices must be documented. Long-term litter decomposition experiments such as LIDET provide a real-world process-oriented benchmark to evaluate models.},

   journal = {Ecological Applications},
   volume = {16},
   number = {6},
   pages = {2123-2142},
   abstract = {Quantifying where, when, and how much denitrification occurs on the basis of measurements alone remains particularly vexing at virtually all spatial scales. As a result, models have become essential tools for integrating current understanding of the processes that control denitrification with measurements of rate-controlling properties so that the permanent losses of N within landscapes can be quantified at watershed and regional scales. In this paper, we describe commonly used approaches for modeling denitrification and N cycling processes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems based on selected examples from the literature. We highlight future needs for developing complementary measurements and models of denitrification. Most of the approaches described here do not explicitly simulate microbial dynamics, but make predictions by representing the environmental conditions where denitrification is expected to occur, based on conceptualizations of the N cycle and empirical data from field and laboratory investigations of the dominant process controls. Models of denitrification in terrestrial ecosystems include generally similar rate-controlling variables, but vary in their complexity of the descriptions of natural and human-related properties of the landscape, reflecting a range of scientific and management perspectives. Models of denitrification in aquatic ecosystems range in complexity from highly detailed mechanistic simulations of the N cycle to simpler source?transport models of aggregate N removal processes estimated with empirical functions, though all estimate aquatic N removal using first-order reaction rate or mass-transfer rate expressions. Both the terrestrial and aquatic modeling approaches considered here generally indicate that denitrification is an important and highly substantial component of the N cycle over large spatial scales. However, the uncertainties of model predictions are large. Future progress will be linked to advances in field measurements, spatial databases, and model structures.},

   abstract = {Bruggeman et al. [J. Bruggeman, H. Burchard, B. Kooi, B. Sommeijer, A second-order, unconditionally positive, mass-conserving integration scheme for biochemical systems, Applied Numerical Mathematics 57 (1) (2007) 36–58] presented novel first and second-order implicit integration schemes which guarantee both conservation (in a strict biochemical sense) and positive-definite results (hereafter, BBKS1 and BBKS2 respectively). In this paper we show that it is possible to achieve substantially more accurate results by making a minor modification to the BBKS-schemes (hereafter, we refer to the revised first- and second-order schemes as mBBKS1 and mBBKS2). The BBKS and the mBBKS schemes are shown to be special cases of a more generalized scheme (dubbed gBBKS). All operate by automatically slowing the forecaster time-step-averaged reaction rates in order to maintain positivity. The mBBKS scheme induces less slowing than the BBKS one. With a second modification, gBBKS-type schemes can become unusual adaptive-time-step schemes. Unfortunately, for the ODE-systems that we examined, the adaptive-mBBKS variant proves to be substantially less efficient than standard adaptive schemes (in this instance, adaptive time-step second-order explicit Runge–Kutta). Nonetheless, it is possible that the adaptive-mBBKS-scheme would become more competitive when the right-hand sides of a system of ODEs are more expensive to evaluate.},

First, state variables in such systems represent non-negative quantities, such as concentrations of chemical compounds. Second, biochemical systems conserve mass and energy. Both properties must be reflected in results of an integration scheme applied to biochemical models. This paper first presents a mathematical framework for biochemical problems, which includes an exact definition of biochemical conservation: elements and energy, rather than state variable units, are conserved. We then analyze various fixed-step integration schemes, including traditional Euler-based schemes and the recently published modified Patankar schemes, and conclude that none of these deliver unconditional positivity and biochemical conservation in combination with higher-order accuracy. Finally, we present two new fixed-step integration schemes, one first-order and one second-order accurate, which do guarantee positivity and (biochemical) conservation.},

Such model systems do typically arise in geobiochemical modelling where the reproduction of these properties is vital. We suggest modified Patankar-type methods of first- and second-order in time and compare their performance by means of approximating simple linear and non-linear model problems. For the non-linear model problem, a hybrid method combining the classical Runge–Kutta scheme with a modified Patankar-type scheme gives the best numerical approximation. The classical Robertson test problem for chemical reactions which is known for its stiffness is excellently approximated with the modified Patankar-type scheme. The procedure with respect to the derivation and analysis of the modified Patankar-type schemes can be used as a guideline to develop even unconditionally positive, conservative and third-order as well as higher order methods.},

   abstract = {The kinetics of nutrient uptake for nitrate ion are developed for four species of phytoplankton, and for ammonium ion for two species of phytoplankton. All cases are shown to be well described by the Michaelis-Menten hyperbolas. The two sets of half-saturation constants do not show significant interspecific variation, nor do they show intraspecific variation with different steady-state preconditioning growth rates. The maximum uptake rate parameter shows marked intraspecific variability that is positively correlated with the preconditioning growth rate of the population. This linear function, combined with the limiting nutrient uptake hyperbola and the relation between growth rate and the nutritional state of the population developed in Part I of this paper, provides a model that relates steady-state growth rate to environmental substrate concentration. The model is used to explain the failure to observe significant growth rate related variation in environmental limiting nutrient concentration at different steady-state growth rates in the chemostat. The evidence suggests that this model would be applicable to field situations for a mixed phytoplankton population in either a nitrate- or ammonium-limited environment, but the very low range of nutrient concentration involved would require more precision in nutrient analysis than is presently available.},

   abstract = {The affinity of iron oxides and hydroxides for phosphorus is thought to contribute to phosphorus limitation to net primary productivity in humid tropical forests on acidic, highly weathered soils. Perennially warm, humid conditions and high biological activity in these soils can result in fluctuating redox potential that in turn leads to considerable iron reduction in the presence of labile carbon and humic substances. We investigated the effects of reducing conditions in combination with the addition of labile carbon substrates (glucose and acetate) and an electron shuttle compound on iron reduction and phosphorus release in a humid tropical forest soil. Glucose or acetate was added to soils as a single dose at the beginning of the experiment, and as pulsed inputs over time, which more closely mimics patterns in labile carbon availability. Iron reduction and phosphorus mobilization were weakly stimulated by a single low level addition of carbon, and the addition of the electron shuttle compound with or without added carbon. Pulsed labile carbon additions produced a significant increase in soil pH, soluble iron, and phosphorus concentrations. Pulsed labile carbon inputs also promoted the precipitation of ferrous hydroxide complexes which could increase the capacity for P sorption, although our results suggest that rates of P solubilization exceeded re-adsorption. Plant and microbial P demand are also likely to serve as an important sinks for released P, limiting the role of P re-adsorption. Our results suggest that reducing conditions coupled with periodic carbon inputs can stimulate iron reduction and a corresponding increase in soil phosphorus mobilization, which may provide a source of phosphorus to plants and microorganisms previously undocumented in these ecosystems.},

The enzyme-driven component is here represented by a Rubisco-related nitrogen reservoir that interacts with plant?soil nitrogen cycling and other components of a climate model. Previous canopy carbon models included in GCMs have assumed either fixed leaf nitrogen, that is, prescribed photosynthetic capacities, or an optimization between leaf nitrogen and light levels so that in either case stomatal conductance varied only with light levels and temperature. A nitrogen model is coupled to a previously derived but here modified carbon model and includes, besides the enzyme reservoir, additional plant stores for leaf structure and roots. It also includes organic and mineral reservoirs in the soil; the latter are generated, exchanged, and lost by biological fixation, deposition and fertilization, mineralization, nitrification, root uptake, denitrification, and leaching. The root nutrient uptake model is a novel and simple, but rigorous, treatment of soil transport and root physiological uptake. The other soil components are largely derived from previously published parameterizations and global budget constraints. The feasibility of applying the derived biogeochemical cycling model to climate model calculations of evapotranspiration is demonstrated through its incorporation in the Biosphere?Atmosphere Transfer Scheme land model and a 17-yr Atmospheric Model Inter comparison Project II integration with the NCAR CCM3 GCM.

Karst.) seedlings grown under controlled conditions in a semi-hydroponic culture system with quartz sand as substrate and a percolating nutrient solution. The culture system allowed the determination of nutrient uptake rates in mycorrhizal root systems with an intact extramatrical mycelium. The rate of infection of the roots by the mycorrhizal fungi Pisolithus tinctorius and Laccaria laccata was high but the rate of infection by Paxillus involutus was low. When supplied with ammonium nitrate, the d. wt of the roots and particularly of the shoots was significantly lower in mycorrhizal than in non–mycorrhizal plants. Despite the lower root d. wt, the number of root tips and the root branching ratio (number of root tips per unit root length) were significantly higher in mycorrhizal plants infected with L. laccata and P. tinctorius than in non–mycorrhizal plants. The depletion of ammonium in the external solution was faster than the depletion of nitrate. Nitrate uptake rates increased at ammonium concentrations below 400μM. The maximal N uptake rates (Vmax), calculated after Lineweaver–Burk, were significantly higher for ammonium than for nitrate. The N uptake rates did not differ significantly between non–mycorrhizal and mycorrhizai plants. The concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg tended to be higher in the smaller mycorrhizal than in the larger non–mycorrhizal plants. A significant increase in mineral nutrient concentration in mycorrhizal compared with non–mycorrhizal plants was found only for N concentrations in the needles of mycorrhizal plants infected with P. tinctorius. When they were supplied with ammonium ((NH4), SO4) as source of N, but not when they were supplied with nitrate (KNO3), the d. wt was lower in mycorrhizal plants infected with P. tinctorius than it was in non-mycorrhizal plants. Therefore, N uptake rates were increased in mycorrhizai plants with P. tinctorius only when they were supplied with ammonium but not with nitrate. The insignificant differences in uptake rates of N, P, K, Ca and Mg between non–mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants indicate that at unlimited spatial nutrient availability the contribution of the extramatrical mycelium to nutrient uptake by mycorrhizal plants was small. It is suggested that the decreased growth of mycorrhizal plants is due to the demand of the mycorrhizal fungus for photosynthates, i.e. source limitation.},

   abstract = {A comprehensive biokinetic model employing Michaelis?Menten-type kinetics, H2 thresholds, and thermodynamic limitations on donor fermentation was used to describe both fermentation of electron donors and competition for the evolved H2 between hydrogenotrophic tetrachloroethene dechlorinators and methanogens. Model simulations compared favorably to experimental data where delivery of H2 to a tetrachloroethene dechlorinator was accomplished using the donors butyric acid, ethanol, lactic acid, and propionic acid. Fermentations of the different donors were characterized by different dynamic patterns of H2 generation that were captured successfully by the model. Experimental data and model simulations show that the ability to use H2 at appreciable rates at low levels provides a competitive advantage to dechlorinators over methanogens. Slowly fermented substrates producing lower H2 levels?kinetically accessible to dechlorinators, but too low for significant use by methanogenic competitors?were more effective and persistent ?selective? stimulators of dechlorination than rapidly fermented substrates producing higher H2 levels?accessible to both dechlorinators and methanogens. Model simulations suggest that adding excessive levels of rapidly fermented, high H2-level-generating donors in an attempt to overcome competition, instead results in a dominant methanogen population and an eventual failure of dechlorination. When stimulating dechlorination, the quality of the donor as well as the quantity added must be considered.},

   abstract = {We estimated rates of heterotrophic bacterial and phytoplankton uptake of nitrate, ammonium, and urea using 15N-labelled nitrogen and specific metabolic inhibitors of prokaryote and eukaryote nitrogen metabolism in the surface waters of the North Water (northern Baffin Bay) during autumn that were characterized by the absence of cyanobacteria (comprising prochlorophytes). The percentage of nitrate + ammonium uptake by heterotrophic bacteria ranged between 44 and 78\% of the measured total uptake and was the highest when the phytoplankton biomass was relatively low (<2 μg Chlorophyll a L−1). Phytoplankton accounted for a larger fraction (e.g., 58–95\%) of urea uptake than heterotrophic bacteria. When our results are combined with those from previous studies carried out in diverse temperate and polar areas, it appears that heterotrophic bacteria account for ∼25\% (14–40\%; median and interquartile range) of the total nitrate uptake in surface waters with chlorophyll biomass <2 μg L−1. Estimates of new production computed from phytoplankton carbon uptake and f-ratios may be strongly overestimated in regions where nitrate uptake by heterotrophic bacteria is high and the biomass of phytoplankton is low.},

   abstract = {Precipitation variability and magnitude are expected to change in many parts of the world over the 21st century. We examined the potential effects of intra-annual rainfall patterns on soil nitrogen (N) transport and transformation in the unsaturated soil zone using a deterministic dynamic modeling approach. The model (TOUGHREACT-N), which has been tested and applied in several experimental and observational systems, mechanistically accounts for microbial activity, soil moisture dynamics that respond to precipitation variability, and gaseous and aqueous tracer transport in the soil. Here, we further tested and calibrated the model against data from a precipitation variability experiment in a tropical system in Costa Rica. The model was then used to simulate responses of soil moisture, microbial dynamics, N leaching, and N trace-gas emissions to changes in rainfall patterns; the effect of soil texture was also examined. The temporal variability of nitrate leaching and NO, NH3, and N2O effluxes were significantly influenced by rainfall dynamics. Soil texture combined with rainfall dynamics altered soil moisture dynamics, and consequently regulated soil N responses to precipitation changes. The clay loam soil more effectively buffered water stress during relatively long intervals between precipitation events, particularly after a large rainfall event. Subsequent soil N aqueous and gaseous losses showed either increases or decreases in response to increasing precipitation variability due to complex soil moisture dynamics. For a high rainfall scenario, high precipitation variability resulted in as high as 2.4-, 2.4-, 1.2-, and 13-fold increases in NH3, NO, N2O and NO3− fluxes, respectively, in clay loam soil. In sandy loam soil, however, NO and N2O fluxes decreased by 15% and 28%, respectively, in response to high precipitation variability. Our results demonstrate that soil N cycling responses to increasing precipitation variability depends on precipitation amount and soil texture, and that accurate prediction of future N cycling and gas effluxes requires models with relatively sophisticated representation of the relevant processes.},

We developed a non-spatial biogeochemical model to simulate soil and surface water chemistry by linking the daily version of the CENTURY ecosystem model (DayCent) with a low temperature aqueous geochemical model, PHREEQC. The coupled model, DayCent-Chem, simulates the daily dynamics of plant production, soil organic matter, cation exchange, mineral weathering, elution, stream discharge, and solute concentrations in soil water and stream flow. By aerially weighting the contributions of separate bedrock/talus and tundra simulations, the model was able to replicate the measured seasonal and annual stream chemistry for most solutes for Andrews Creek in Loch Vale watershed, Rocky Mountain National Park. Simulated soil chemistry, net primary production, live biomass, and soil organic matter for forest and tundra matched well with measurements. This model is appropriate for accurately describing ecosystem and surface water chemical response to atmospheric deposition and climate change.},

   abstract = {Maximum annual development of the active layer above permafrost has been monitored at seven 1-km2 Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) sites in northern Alaska since 1995. Grid nodes are spaced at 100-m intervals, yielding a regular array of 121 (11 × 11) data collection points. Three sites are located in the Arctic Foothills physiographic province, and four are on the Arctic Coastal Plain. Air and soil temperature measurements are made at each site, and soil moisture is monitored at most. Six years of record permit several general conclusions: (1) At the landscape scale, end-of-season thaw depth is strongly correlated with local air temperature on an interannual basis. All sites experienced maximum average thaw depth in 1998 and a minimum in 2000, consistent with the warmest and coolest summers during the period of record. The active layer, however, may exhibit Markovian behavior over multidecadal periods. (2) There is significant intrasite variation in thaw depth and near-surface soil moisture content within each 1-km2 grid, reflecting the local influence of vegetation, substrate properties, snow cover dynamics, and terrain. (3) On the Coastal Plain, thaw depth is significantly greater in drained thaw-lake basins, resulting in a bimodal distribution of thaw depth related to primary landscape elements. (4) Foothills sites demonstrate large spatial and interannual variability resulting from microtopography and temporal variations of soil moisture content, making predictive mapping of thaw depth problematic at the scale and resolution of the grids. The spatial pattern of thaw depth across sites on the Coastal Plain is relatively consistent, although lake margins exhibit more complex patterns attributable to fluctuating water levels.},

   abstract = {Kinetic parameters for NH4+ and NO3− uptake were measured in intact roots of Lolium perenne and actively N2-fixing Trifolium repens. Simultaneously, net H+ fluxes between the roots and the root medium were recorded, as were the net photosynthetic rate and transpiration of the leaves. A Michaelis–Menten-type high-affinity system operated in the concentration range up to about 500 mmol m−3 NO3− or NH4+. In L. perenne, the Vmax of this system was 9–11 and 13–14 μmol g−1 root FW h−1 for NO3− and NH4+, respectively. The corresponding values in T. repens were 5–7 and 2 μmol g−1 root FW h−1. The Km for NH4+ uptake was much lower in L. perenne than in T. repens (c. 40 compared with 170 mmol m−3), while Km values for NO3− absorption were roughly similar (around 130 mmol m−3) in the two species. There were no indications of a significant efflux component in the net uptake of the two ions. The translocation rate to the shoots of nitrogen derived from absorbed NO3−-N was higher in T. repens than in L. perenne, while the opposite was the case for nitrogen absorbed as NH4+. Trifolium repens had higher rates of transpiration and net photosynthesis than L. perenne. Measurements of net H+ fluxes between roots and nutrient solution showed that L. perenne absorbing NO3− had a net uptake of H+, while L. perenne with access to NH4+ and T. repens, with access to NO3− or NH4+, in all cases acidified the nutrient solution. Within the individual combinations of plant species and inorganic N form, the net H+ fluxes varied only a little with external N concentration and, hence, with the absorption rate of inorganic N. Based on assessment of the net H+ fluxes in T. repens, nitrogen absorption rate via N2 fixation was similar to that of inorganic N and was not down-regulated by exposure to inorganic N for 2 h. It is concluded that L. perenne will have a competitive advantage over T. repens with respect to inorganic N acquisition.},

As part of the SUPER program, NH+4 and NO-3 uptake by heterotrophic bacteria in the sub-Arctic Pacific was examined and compared with use of dissolved free amino acids (DFAA). Heterotrophic bacteria accounted for 31\% (range of 5–40\%) and 32\% (5–60\%) of total uptake of NH+4 and NO-3, respectively, over 4 months of study. Although the average uptake of NO-3 by bacteria was equal to that of NH+4, bacteria actually assimilated relatively more NO-3 than NH+4 in those samples when the two processes were measured simultaneously. Uptake of NH+4 or NO-3 alone was about equal to bacterial biomass production, whereas uptake of dissolved free amino acids (DFAA) was only 40\% of bacterial production, suggesting that the uptake of other dissolved organic nitrogen sources is relatively small. Uptake of NH+4 by bacteria correlated significantly with bacterial production, and both NH+4 uptake and bacterial production correlated significantly with DFAA turnover. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between any microbial parameter and NO-3 uptake. Biomass production of heterotrophic bacteria appears to be supported largely by DIN uptake and, to a lesser extent, uptake of DFAA in the sub-Arctic Pacific. Uptake of NO-3 is more important in supporting bacterial growth than previously hypothesized, although it remains the least preferred N source.},

This competition is especially strong in the rhizosphere. To evaluate competitive and mutualistic interactions between plants and microorganisms and to analyse ecological consequences of these interactions, we analysed 424 data pairs from 41 15N-labelling studies that investigated 15N redistribution between roots and microorganisms. Calculated Michaelis–Menten kinetics based on Km (Michaelis constant) and Vmax (maximum uptake capacity) values from 77 studies on the uptake of nitrate, ammonia, and amino acids by roots and microorganisms clearly showed that, shortly after nitrogen (N) mobilization from soil organic matter and litter, microorganisms take up most N. Lower Km values of microorganisms suggest that they are especially efficient at low N concentrations, but can also acquire more N at higher N concentrations (Vmax) compared with roots. Because of the unidirectional flow of nutrients from soil to roots, plants are the winners for N acquisition in the long run. Therefore, despite strong competition between roots and microorganisms for N, a temporal niche differentiation reflecting their generation times leads to mutualistic relationships in the rhizosphere. This temporal niche differentiation is highly relevant ecologically because it: protects ecosystems from N losses by leaching during periods of slow or no root uptake; continuously provides roots with available N according to plant demand; and contributes to the evolutionary development of mutualistic interactions between roots and microorganisms.},

   abstract = {Previous research showed that anaerobic respiration using iron (Fe) oxides as terminal electron acceptor contributed substantially to ecosystem respiration (ER) in a drained thaw lake basin (DTLB) on the Arctic coastal plain. As DTLBs age, the surface organic layer thickens, progressively burying the Fe-rich mineral layers. We therefore hypothesized that Fe(III) availability and Fe reduction would decline with basin age. We studied four DTLBs across an age gradient, comparing seasonal changes in the oxidation state of dissolved and extractable Fe pools and the estimated contribution of Fe reduction to ER. The organic layer thickness did not strictly increase with age for these four sites, though soil Fe levels decreased with increasing organic layer thickness. However, there were surprisingly high levels of Fe minerals in organic layers, especially in the ancient basin where cryoturbation may have transported Fe upward through the profile. Net reduction of Fe oxides occurred in the latter half of the summer and contributed an estimated 40–45% to ecosystem respiration in the sites with the thickest organic layers and 61–63% in the sites with the thinnest organic layers. All sites had high concentrations of soluble Fe(II) and Fe(III), explained by the presence of siderophores, and this pool became progressively more reduced during the first half of the summer. Redox titrations with humic acid (HA) extracts and chelated Fe support our view that this pattern indicates the reduction of HA during this interval. We conclude that Fe(III) and HA reductions contribute broadly to ER in the Arctic coastal plain.},

TOUGHREACT-N was calibrated and tested against field measurements to assess pathways of N loss as either gas emission or solute leachate following fertilization and irrigation in a Central Valley, California, agricultural field as functions of fertilizer application rate and depth, and irrigation water volume. Our results, relative to the period before plants emerge, show that an increase in fertilizer rate produced a nonlinear response in terms of N losses. An increase of irrigation volume produced NO2− and NO3− leaching, whereas an increase in fertilization depth mainly increased leaching of all N solutes. In addition, nitrifying bacteria largely increased in mass with increasing fertilizer rate. Increases in water application caused nitrifiers and denitrifiers to decrease and increase their mass, respectively, while nitrifiers and denitrifiers reversed their spatial stratification when fertilizer was applied below 15 cm depth. Coupling aqueous advection and diffusion, and gaseous diffusion with biological processes, closely captured actual conditions and, in the system explored here, significantly clarified interpretation of field measurements.},

   abstract = {In the last 80 years, a number of mathematical models of different level of complexity have been developed to describe biogeochemical processes in soils, spanning spatial scales from few μm to thousands of km and temporal scales from hours to centuries. Most of these models are based on kinetic and stoichiometric laws that constrain elemental cycling within the soil and the nutrient and carbon exchange with vegetation and the atmosphere. While biogeochemical model performance has been previously assessed in other reviews, less attention has been devoted to the mathematical features of the models, and how these are related to spatial and temporal scales. In this review, we consider ∼250 biogeochemical models, highlighting similarities in their theoretical frameworks and illustrating how their mathematical structure and formulation are related to the spatial and temporal scales of the model applications. Our analysis shows that similar kinetic and stoichiometric laws, formulated to mechanistically represent the complex underlying biochemical constraints, are common to most models, providing a basis for their classification. Moreover, a historic analysis reveals that the complexity and degree and number of nonlinearities generally increased with date, while they decreased with increasing spatial and temporal scale of interest. We also found that mathematical formulations specifically developed for certain scales (e.g., first order decay rates assumed in yearly time scale decomposition models) often tend to be used also at other spatial and temporal scales different from the original ones, possibly resulting in inconsistencies between theoretical formulations and model application. It is thus critical that future modeling efforts carefully account for the scale-dependence of their mathematical formulations, especially when applied to a wide range of scales.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: The uptake of ammonium, nitrate, amino acids and urea was examined in the nitrate-rich Thames estuary and adjacent area in the North Sea during February 1999. The majority of uptake was by heterotrophic bacteria, as demonstrated by addition of a prokaryotic inhibitor that lowered uptake rates by 82, 66, 49 and 86/% for ammonium, nitrate, amino acids and urea, respectively. Amino acids were preferred over ammonium and urea, which in turn were preferred over nitrate. Urea was not important as nitrogen substrate. Amino acids were the main nitrogen substrate offshore and at the mouth of the estuary, but in the inner estuary nitrogen was mainly taken up as ammonium and, even more, as nitrate. Nitrate appeared to be the main substrate in the inner estuary (60 to 90/%) despite its low affinity for nitrate. The high nitrate uptake by heterotrophic bacteria is probably due to high ambient concentrations of nitrate (up to 650 µM).},

   abstract = {▪ Abstract Because it is very toxic and accumulates in organisms, particularly in fish, mercury is an important pollutant and one of the most studied. Nonetheless we still have an incomplete understanding of the factors that control the bioconcentration of mercury. Elemental mercury is efficiently transported as a gas around the globe, and even remote areas show evidence of mercury pollution originating from industrial sources such as power plants. Besides elemental mercury, the major forms of mercury in water are ionic mercury (which is bound to chloride, sulfide, or organic acids) and organic mercury, particularly methylmercury. Methylmercury rather than inorganic mercury is bioconcentrated because it is better retained by organisms at various levels in the food chain. The key factor determining the concentration of mercury in the biota is the methylmercury concentration in water, which is controlled by the relative efficiency of the methylation and demethylation processes. Anoxic waters and sediments are an important source of methylmercury, apparently as the result of the methylating activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria. In surface waters, methylmercury may originate from anoxic layers or be formed through poorly known biological or chemical processes. Demethylation is effected both photochemically and biologically.},

   abstract = {We present results from a study of soil solution concentrations of ammonium (NH4 +), nitrate (NO3 –), and amino acid N over one growing season along a local 90-m-long plant productivity gradient in a boreal forest. Three forest types are found along the gradient: an ericaceous dwarf-shrub type between 0 and 40 m, a low-herb type between 40 and 80 m, and a tall-herb type at 90 m. Soil sampling of the mor layer was performed in June, July, August and October in the three forest types. In addition, plant uptake of NH4 +, NO3 – and the amino acid glycine was investigated. A mixture of the three N forms was injected into the soil; one N form at a time was labeled with 15N, and in the case of glycine also with 13C. In the dwarf-shrub forest, where plant productivity was low, the soil N pool was strongly dominated by amino acid N. There, plants took up more NH4 + than NO3 –. Glycine uptake did not differ significantly from either NH4 + or NO3 – uptake. Along the gradient, soil concentrations of NH4 + and NO3 – increased, as did plant productivity. In the low-herb forest NH4 + comprised a major portion of the soil N pool, and plants took up more NH4 + than NO3 – or glycine. In the tall-herb forest, NO3 – was as abundant as NH4 +, and together these two N forms dominated the soil N pool. Here, plants took up nearly equal amounts of NO3 – and NH4 +, and this uptake exceeded that of glycine severalfold. Apart from the overall preference for NH4 + that plants exhibited throughout the gradient, the results show a correlation between soil concentrations of amino acids and NO3 – and plant preferences for these N forms.},

   abstract = {We describe a model of N2 and N2O gas fluxes from nitrification and denitrification. The model was developed using laboratory denitrification gas flux data and field-observed N2O gas fluxes from different sites. Controls over nitrification N2O gas fluxes are soil texture, soil NH4, soil water-filled pore space, soil N turnover rate, soil pH, and soil temperature. Observed data suggest that nitrification N2O gas fluxes are proportional to soil N turnover and that soil NH4 levels only impact N2O gas fluxes with high levels of soil NH4 (>3 μg N g−1). Total denitrification (N2 plus N2O) gas fluxes are a function of soil heterotrophic respiration rates, soil NO3, soil water content, and soil texture. N2:N2O ratio is a function of soil water content, soil NO3, and soil heterotrophic respiration rates. The denitrification model was developed using laboratory data [Weier et al, 1993] where soil water content, soil NO3, and soil C availability were varied using a full factorial design. The Weier's model simulated observed N2 and N2O gas fluxes for different soils quite well with r2 equal to 0.62 and 0.75, respectively. Comparison of simulated model results with field N2O data for several validation sites shows that the model results compare well with the observed data (r2 = 0.62). Winter denitrification events were poorly simulated by the model. This problem could have been caused by spatial and temporal variations in the observed soil water data and N2O fluxes. The model results and observed data suggest that approximately 14% of the N2O fluxes for a shortgrass steppe are a result of denitrification and that this percentage ranged from 0% to 59% for different sites.},

   abstract = {We describe a submodel to simulate NOx and N2O emissions from soils and present comparisons of simulated NOx and N2O fluxes from the DAYCENT ecosystem model with observations from different soils. The N gas flux submodel assumes that nitrification and denitrification both contribute to N2O and NOx emissions but that NOx emissions are due mainly to nitrification. N2O emissions from nitrification are calculated as a function of modeled soil NH4+ concentration, water-filled pore space (WFPS), temperature, pH, and texture. N2O emissions from denitrification are a function of soil NO3− concentration, WFPS, heterotrophic respiration, and texture. NOx emissions are calculated by multiplying total N2O emissions by a NOx:N2O equation which is calculated as a function of soil parameters (bulk density, field capacity, and WFPS) that influence gas diffusivity. The NOx submodel also simulates NOx emission pulses initiated by rain events onto dry soils. The DAYCENT model was tested by comparing observed and simulated parameters in grassland soils across a range of soil textures and fertility levels. Simulated values of soil temperature, WFPS (during the non-winter months), and NOx gas flux agreed reasonably well with measured values (r2 = 0.79, 0.64, and 0.43, respectively). Winter season WFPS was poorly simulated (r2 = 0.27). Although the correlation between simulated and observed N2O flux was poor on a daily basis (r2 = 0.02), DAYCENT was able to reproduce soil textural and treatment differences and the observed seasonal patterns of gas flux emissions with r2 values of 0.26 and 0.27, for monthly and NOr flux rates, respectively.},

   journal = {Tree Physiology},
   volume = {29},
   number = {3},
   pages = {389-399},
   abstract = {In southeastern Australia, the overstory species Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. commonly grows with either of the two leguminous understory trees, Acacia melanoxylon (R. Br. Ex Ait. f.) or Acacia dealbata (Link.). Our objective was to elucidate interactions between the dominant eucalypt and its companion acacias for nitrogen (N) sources. Use of stable N isotopes as tracers revealed that ammonium was the preferred soil N source for all species, nevertheless, total N uptake varied greatly among species. Studies with double-labeled (13C/15N) glutamine indicated the uptake of this form of organic N in small amounts by both E. regnans and the Acacia spp. These and other data imply that, in contrast to boreal forests, organic N is not a significant component of N nutrition in mountain ash forests. Field and laboratory studies provided evidence that N2-fixation capacity of acacias varies with stand development, with N-fixing species playing an important role in N nutrition during the early but not the mature stages of forest growth. An index of N-uptake efficiency – the amount of oxygen consumed per unit N taken up – was compared across four N sources and three species. Nitrate uptake was the least efficient form of N acquisition, especially compared with ammonium uptake which was up to 30-fold less costly. Efficiency of glutamine uptake was intermediate between that of ammonium and nitrate. Differences in uptake efficiency among N forms were most pronounced for the Acacia spp. and least for E. regnans. We conclude that an overlap in requirements among sympatric Acacia spp. and E. regnans for specific soil N sources can be bypassed because of changes in biochemical strategies of Acacia spp. triggered by increasing soil N concentrations during stand development. Further studies might elucidate whether this is a common feature of complex forest ecosystems, or a specialty of the interaction between eucalypts and acacias.},

   abstract = {* Considerable uncertainty surrounds the fate of Amazon rainforests in response to climate change. * Here, carbon (C) flux predictions of five terrestrial biosphere models (Community Land Model version 3.5 (CLM3.5), Ecosystem Demography model version 2.1 (ED2), Integrated BIosphere Simulator version 2.6.4 (IBIS), Joint UK Land Environment Simulator version 2.1 (JULES) and Simple Biosphere model version 3 (SiB3)) and a hydrodynamic terrestrial ecosystem model (the Soil–Plant–Atmosphere (SPA) model) were evaluated against measurements from two large-scale Amazon drought experiments. * Model predictions agreed with the observed C fluxes in the control plots of both experiments, but poorly replicated the responses to the drought treatments. Most notably, with the exception of ED2, the models predicted negligible reductions in aboveground biomass in response to the drought treatments, which was in contrast to an observed c. 20% reduction at both sites. For ED2, the timing of the decline in aboveground biomass was accurate, but the magnitude was too high for one site and too low for the other. * Three key findings indicate critical areas for future research and model development. First, the models predicted declines in autotrophic respiration under prolonged drought in contrast to measured increases at one of the sites. Secondly, models lacking a phenological response to drought introduced bias in the sensitivity of canopy productivity and respiration to drought. Thirdly, the phenomenological water-stress functions used by the terrestrial biosphere models to represent the effects of soil moisture on stomatal conductance yielded unrealistic diurnal and seasonal responses to drought.},

   abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable of the climate system. It constrains plant transpiration and photosynthesis in several regions of the world, with consequent impacts on the water, energy and biogeochemical cycles. Moreover it is a storage component for precipitation and radiation anomalies, inducing persistence in the climate system. Finally, it is involved in a number of feedbacks at the local, regional and global scales, and plays a major role in climate-change projections. In this review, we provide a synthesis of past research on the role of soil moisture for the climate system, based both on modelling and observational studies. We focus on soil moisture–temperature and soil moisture–precipitation feedbacks, and their possible modifications with climate change. We also highlight further impacts of soil moisture on climate, and the state of research regarding the validation of the relevant processes. There are promises for major advances in this research field in coming years thanks to the development of new validation datasets and multi-model initiatives. However, the availability of ground observations continues to be critical in limiting progress and should therefore strongly be fostered at the international level. Exchanges across disciplines will also be essential for bridging current knowledge gaps in this field. This is of key importance given the manifold impacts of soil moisture on climate, and their relevance for climate-change projections. A better understanding and quantification of the relevant processes would significantly help to reduce uncertainties in future-climate scenarios, in particular with regard to changes in climate variability and extreme events, as well as ecosystem and agricultural impacts.},

When the lab-determined parameters were applied in the field-scale simulation, the estimated rate coefficient for EVO hydrolysis in the field was about 1 order of magnitude greater than that in the microcosms. Model results suggested that precipitation of long-chain fatty acids, produced from EVO hydrolysis, with Ca in the aquifer created a secondary long-term electron donor source. The model predicted substantial accumulation of denitrifying and sulfate-reducing bacteria, and U(IV) precipitates. The accumulation was greatest near the injection wells and along the lateral boundaries of the treatment zone where electron donors mixed with electron acceptors in the groundwater. While electron acceptors such as sulfate were generally considered to compete with U(VI) for electrons, this work highlighted their role in providing electron acceptors for microorganisms to degrade complex substrates thereby enhancing U(VI) reduction and immobilization.},

   abstract = {We tested a variety of methods for determining steady state solutions for Biome-BGC, a coupled model of terrestrial water, carbon, and nitrogen dynamics. Our objective was to identify methods that could reduce the computational cost of model spin-up relative to simulations running under the model's native dynamics, while retaining or improving upon the simulation quality, where quality is judged by comparison to assumed values for the true steady state solution. Two classes of methods were tested: ad hoc methods that approximate steady state by taking advantage of specific characteristics of the modeled dynamics to produce individual time trajectories through the model state space, and general multivariate minimization methods that iteratively explore multiple time trajectories through state space in search of a reasonable steady state solution. We examined the behavior of these methods for both woody and herbaceous vegetation simulations. We found that both the ad hoc and the generalized methods, parameterized appropriately, could provide reductions in computational cost of 50–75% compared to the model's native dynamics. With the exception of the generalized methods for the woody vegetation case, we also found that the quality of the simulated steady state solution was as good as or better than the native dynamics approach. The one method which performed consistently well across sites and vegetation types involved an acceleration of decomposition rates for the spin-up phase, resulting in 73 and 66% reductions in computational cost for woody and herbaceous vegetation types, respectively.},

   abstract = {Microbial communities can potentially mediate feedbacks between global change and ecosystem function, owing to their sensitivity to environmental change and their control over critical biogeochemical processes. Numerous ecosystem models have been developed to predict global change effects, but most do not consider microbial mechanisms in detail. In this idea paper, we examine the extent to which incorporation of microbial ecology into ecosystem models improves predictions of carbon (C) dynamics under warming, changes in precipitation regime, and anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment. We focus on three cases in which this approach might be especially valuable: temporal dynamics in microbial responses to environmental change, variation in ecological function within microbial communities, and N effects on microbial activity. Four microbially-based models have addressed these scenarios. In each case, predictions of the microbial-based models differ—sometimes substantially—from comparable conventional models. However, validation and parameterization of model performance is challenging. We recommend that the development of microbial-based models must occur in conjunction with the development of theoretical frameworks that predict the temporal responses of microbial communities, the phylogenetic distribution of microbial functions, and the response of microbes to N enrichment.},

Although microbial N uptake was generally dominated by DIN (especially NH4+), DON (both urea and DFAA) also served as an important N source and occasionally dominated uptake. Uptake of 15N labeled algal derived DON was measured in an attempt to mimic uptake of the complex ambient DON pool. Uptake rates for the algal derived DON in April were similar to those for NH4+ and even higher than the summed uptake of NH4+, NO3−, urea and DFAA in August, suggesting that DON other than urea and DFAA, likely dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA), also served as an important N source. In addition, the relative contributions of heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton to total microbial N uptake was estimated from bacterial productivity and measured by inhibiting bacterial N uptake with antibiotics.},

   abstract = {We developed a microbial-enzyme-mediated decomposition (MEND) model, based on the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, that describes the dynamics of physically defined pools of soil organic matter (SOC). These include particulate, mineral-associated, dissolved organic matter (POC, MOC, and DOC, respectively), microbial biomass, and associated exoenzymes. The ranges and/or distributions of parameters were determined by both analytical steady-state and dynamic analyses with SOC data from the literature. We used an improved multi-objective parameter sensitivity analysis (MOPSA) to identify the most important parameters for the full model: maintenance of microbial biomass, turnover and synthesis of enzymes, and carbon use efficiency (CUE). The model predicted that an increase of 2°C (baseline temperature 12°C) caused the pools of POC-cellulose, MOC, and total SOC to increase with dynamic CUE and decrease with constant CUE, as indicated by the 50% confidence intervals. Regardless of dynamic or constant CUE, the changes in pool size of POC, MOC, and total SOC varied from ?8% to 8% under +2°C. The scenario analysis using a single parameter set indicates that higher temperature with dynamic CUE might result in greater net increases in both POC-cellulose and MOC pools. Different dynamics of various SOC pools reflected the catalytic functions of specific enzymes targeting specific substrates and the interactions between microbes, enzymes, and SOC. With the feasible parameter values estimated in this study, models incorporating fundamental principles of microbial-enzyme dynamics can lead to simulation results qualitatively different from traditional models with fast/slow/passive pools.},

   abstract = {A central assumption of ecosystem N cycling has been that organic N must be converted to inorganic N to be available for plant uptake, but this has been questioned by recent studies. We examined uptake of nitrate, ammonium and the amino acid glycine in three species from Eucalyptus obliqua L'Her. wet forest in Tasmania, south-eastern Australia, to test the hypothesis that all three species can take up glycine, and to compare rates of glycine uptake with rates of uptake of nitrate and ammonium uptake. The alternative hypothesis that species vary in their preference for nitrate, ammonium and glycine (“niche differentiation”) was also examined. Measurements were made on the canopy dominant Eucalyptus obliqua, and two rain forest tree species found in the understory or as sub-dominants of the canopy, Nothofagus cunninghamii (Hook.) Oerst. and Phyllocladus aspleniifolius (Labill.) Hook.f. Nitrogen uptake was examined in situ with attached roots placed in uptake solutions containing equimolar concentrations (100 μmol l−1) of 15N-nitrate, 15N-ammonium and 2-13C215N-glycine. Species did not differ in their preference for different forms of N (species × N form interaction, P > 0.05), and thus there was no evidence of niche differentiation. In all species, rates of uptake were highest for ammonium (11 ± 5 μmol gDM−1 h−1; mean ± SD, n = 108), uptake of glycine occurred at less than half this rate (4.4 ± 2.6 μmol gDM−1 h−1), whereas uptake of nitrate occurred at one-tenth of this rate (0.9 ± 1.2 μmol gDM−1 h−1). The strong positive relationship between 15N and 13C uptake indicated that at least 72% of glycine-N was taken up intact. These findings indicate the potential for considerable uptake of organic N in the field.},

   volume = {32},
   number = {2},
   pages = {145-165},
   abstract = {TOUGHREACT is a numerical simulation program for chemically reactive non-isothermal flows of multiphase fluids in porous and fractured media. The program was written in Fortran 77 and developed by introducing reactive geochemistry into the multiphase fluid and heat flow simulator TOUGH2. A variety of subsurface thermo-physical–chemical processes are considered under a wide range of conditions of pressure, temperature, water saturation, ionic strength, and pH and Eh. Interactions between mineral assemblages and fluids can occur under local equilibrium or kinetic rates. The gas phase can be chemically active. Precipitation and dissolution reactions can change formation porosity and permeability. The program can be applied to many geologic systems and environmental problems, including geothermal systems, diagenetic, and weathering processes, subsurface waste disposal, acid mine drainage remediation, contaminant transport, and groundwater quality. Here we present two examples to illustrate applicability of the program. The first example deals with injectivity effects of mineral scaling in a fractured geothermal reservoir. A major concern in the development of hot dry rock and hot fractured rock reservoirs is achieving and maintaining adequate injectivity, while avoiding the development of preferential short-circuiting flow paths. Rock–fluid interactions and associated mineral dissolution and precipitation effects could have a major impact on the long-term performance of these reservoirs. We used recent European studies as a starting point to explore chemically induced effects of fluid circulation in the geothermal systems. We examine ways in which the chemical composition of reinjected waters can be modified to improve reservoir performance by maintaining or even enhancing injectivity. The second TOUGHREACT application example is related to CO2 geologic sequestration in a saline aquifer. We performed numerical simulations for a commonly encountered Gulf Coast sediment under CO2 injection conditions in order to analyze the impact of CO2 immobilization through carbonate precipitation. Using the data presented in this paper, the CO2 mineral-trapping capability after 10,000 years can reach 60 kg/m3 of sandstone by secondary carbonate mineral precipitation such as siderite, ankerite, and dawsonite. Most of the simulated mineral alteration pattern is consistent with the field observations of natural CO2 reservoirs.},
